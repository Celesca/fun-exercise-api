# Fun Exercise: Developing a Financial Technology Application
This project involves building a financial technology application based on a **predefined API specification**.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following tools and resources
- Java: [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) 
- IDE: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (or any IDE compatible with Spring Boot applications)

## Development Guide
- **Database:** The application utilizes an H2 database, accessible at the [H2 Console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console). 
- **Schema and Data Initialization:** Schema and initial data are automatically created upon application startup. Relevant files: `schema.sql`, `data.sql` (links to files).
- **Swagger UI:** Once the application starts, you can access the Swagger UI at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html), which includes an example controller for reference.
- **API Specification:** Utilize the generated API spec from SwaggerHub. Configure it in the `application.yml` file under the property `springdoc.swagger-ui.url`.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:** Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Import the Project:** Import the project and make sure all dependencies are correctly resolved.
3. **Run the Application:** Ensure that all prerequisites are correctly configured.
4. **H2 Console:** Verify that the schema and data are correctly initialized [H2 Console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console).
   - `Driver Class`: `org.h2.Driver`
   - `JDBC URL`: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
   - `User Name`: `sa`
   - `Password`:

   - ![](h2-data-schema.png)
5. **Looking at the `AccountController`:** You can see that the controller has the following endpoints: 
   - `GET /accounts`: Retrieves an accounts.
   - `POST /accounts/{accountNo}/deposit`: Deposits an amount to the account. 
6. **Testing an API with Swagger UI:** You can test the endpoints using the Swagger UI at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).
    - `POST /accounts/{accountNo}/deposit`: deposits an amount to the account.
      - ![](swagger-6.1.png)
    - **Make a change:** Go to line: 37 `@Operation(summary = "withdraw from an account")`
      - Change the value of `summary` to `deposits an amount to the account`.
      - **Rerun the application**, and then we'll see result of that change. ![](swagger-6.2.png)
    - ðŸŽ¨ Try to make any change and learn what happens.
